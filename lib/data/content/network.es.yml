    Come share and learn from others like you.  We all know that the *management* of sleep apnea isn’t always guided by what’s best for each person.  Which tests we get sometimes depends on our insurance coverage.  Which treatment we get also may depend on our insurance and which doctor we see.  Success is defined by how often we use our treatment, rather than how we feel or how it improves our life.  Figuring out what types of treatments are best for each one of us with sleep apnea is hard.

    *MyApnea.org* brings together patients, researchers and doctors all in the same community to share and discuss how to better diagnose and treat sleep apnea to improve all of our lives.

    The promise to shape research is potentially huge.

    The information being collected and potential to change lives is large.

    By contributing information on your sleep apnea and health, researchers will be able to make side-by-side comparisons of different treatments and learn how different treatments help different types of patients.  This opportunity represents a whole new type of partnership with a high level of focus, resources and information aimed at fighting sleep apnea.
