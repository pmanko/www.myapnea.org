  <p>SLEEP APNEA PATIENT CENTERED OUTCOMES STUDY<br />CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN A RESEARCH STUDY</p>
  <p>Study Title: Module 1: The Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Network (also known as MyApnea.org)</p>
  <p>The Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Network (SAPCON) is a medical research study conducted across the U.S., supported by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). The study is being led by groups of doctors, patients and other stakeholders working together. Dr. Susan Redline from Brigham and Women’s Hospital is the study Principal Investigator. She and SAPCON staff are available to answer any questions you may have.</p>
  <p>Research studies include only people who choose to take part. Please take your time to make your decision about participating, and discuss your decision with your family or friends if you wish. If you have any questions, you may ask the researchers.</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>Why is this study being done?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The purpose of the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcome Network is to actively engage people with sleep apnea, or who have a family member with the condition, to share health information needed for research that will improve the health and well-being of adults and children with sleep apnea.</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>How many people will take part in this study?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We hope to enroll at least 50,000 people into the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Network.</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>Am I eligible to participate in the study?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To participate, you need to be an individual who has been diagnosed with sleep apnea, or be a family member of a patient with diagnosed sleep apnea.</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li><strong>What will happen if I take part in this research study?</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p><em>Surveys</em></p>
  <p>If you agree to participate in the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Network, you will be asked to complete a series of surveys about your sleep, symptoms and health. The surveys will ask about such things as when you were diagnosed with sleep apnea, treatments you have used, medical illnesses such as high blood pressure, and your energy level. The basic surveys will take less than one hour to complete for most people.</p>
  <p>You will be asked to update information on these surveys every 2 to 6 months or as your health changes.</p>
  <p>Information collected about you will be combined with information from other patients in the Network to describe the health outcomes being studied by SAPCON. Other patients and researchers will be able to view graphs and summary information on groups of patients. When combining this information, your name and other personal information will not be used.</p>
  <p><em>Other study activities</em></p>
  <p>As a SAPCON participant, you may be invited to participate in additional study activities, or “modules” of the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Study. Each of these modules has a separate consent form and will be explained in detail so you may determine if you would like to be a part of it. Participation in these additional study modules will be optional. That is, you can still be a Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes study participant without participating.</p>
  <p><em>Reminders and study communications</em></p>
  <p>When there is a study activity that we want you to complete or consider, we will contact you. We plan to update your health status every 2 to 6 months. The study will offer a variety of communication options that you can choose from.</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>How long will I be in the study?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We would like to keep track of your health status for at least 2 years, and possibly longer so we know how your health changes over time. Keeping in touch with you and checking on your health periodically over many years is very important to help us look at the long-term effects of sleep apnea and its treatments on health. We plan to do this by contacting you at least twice a year.</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>Can I stop being in the study?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. We won’t delete the information about you that we’ve already collected, but we will stop collecting any new information about you and will stop contacting you.</p>
  <p>To stop participating in the study, please send an email to the study staff at: <a href="mailto:support@myapnea.org">support@myapnea.org</a></p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Although we will do our best to protect your study information (see below), there is still a very small risk of loss of privacy. There is a risk that participating in the study will make you want to access the healthcare system more often, and that costs money. For example, the feedback information that we provide to you (see ‘Benefits’) might make you want to talk to your healthcare provider, or you may want to make extra visits to your provider in order to fill out a survey. While there may often be benefits to you from seeing your healthcare provider, there are also costs, and the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Study will not pay for any part of your medical care. You should not see your healthcare provider solely for the purpose of collecting data for the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Study.</p>
  <p>For more information about risks and side effects, ask one of the researchers.</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>Are there benefits to taking part in the study?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You will not obtain any direct health benefits from participating in the study, but you will receive information on healthy sleep and healthy lifestyle information and sleep apnea news updates. You also will be provided feedback information on topics such as your sleepiness and sleep patterns that are based on the information you provide throughout the study. We hope that by participating you will help us contribute to a better understanding of sleep apnea that will lead to improved health outcomes for the millions of patients with sleep apnea.</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>Will I get advice about my health from the study?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>No. We will provide you with information about symptoms of untreated sleep apnea and available sleep apnea treatments but we will not provide you with specific advice, even if the information you provide us is very abnormal. The health information that we provide to you, including that shared by other patients, does not in any way substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment that your doctor or other healthcare provider may give you. Always ask the advice of your healthcare provider if you have any questions about a medical condition. Do not disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking care because of something you have read as part of this study. If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your doctor or dial 911 immediately.</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You are free to choose not to participate in the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Network. If you decide not to take part, there will be no penalty to you.</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>How is my information protected?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We will do our best to make sure that the personal information we collect about you is kept private and secure. <strong><em>The Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Study</em></strong><em>*</em>will never sell, rent, or lease your contact information.*If information from this study is published or presented at scientific meetings, your name and other personal information will not be used. However, we cannot guarantee total privacy — your personal information may be given out if required by law (e.g., to prevent possible injury to yourself or others).</p>

  <p>PRIVACY POLICY AND DATA SECURITY MEASURES</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p><em>We will use your information for research</em>: We collect information about your identity, your health, and some of your behaviors that might help us predict your future health. This information will be used in research analyses and results of these analyses will be will be presented in scientific conferences and published. These presentations and publications will never show any information that identifies you or any other individual in the study. We will share summary information that does not contain any identifying information with other participants in the network, which include members of the National Patient Centered Outcomes Network and research partners in MyApnea.org.</p></li>
    <li><p>We will never sell, rent, or lease your information.</p></li>
    <li><p>We will never voluntarily share identifying information about you without your permission.</p></li>
    <li><p><em>You will be able to see some of your study information</em>: When you registered for the study, you provided us with a username and a password. You can use this to sign into the study and see your Dashboard and some of the health information you’ve provided to us (e.g., your sleep surveys and health profile). You should be very careful not to provide your login information to anyone else, or they could sign in as you and be able to see that same health information. If you are worried that someone else may be using your login information, please let us know immediately, or change your password yourself through the Participant Homepage.</p></li>
    <li><p><em>Electronic Security and Adherence to the HIPAA Privacy Rule</em>: Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Study follows the security guidelines of the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

  </ul>
  <p>DATA SECURITY MEASURES</p>
  <p>The following is a technical explanation of the measures we take to protect your data. If you have any questions about this information, please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:support@myapnea.org">support@myapnea.org</a></p>
  <p>The PHS Research IT Facilities Security Center will host the web and database servers for the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Study. All study information will be stored in linked data tables on the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Study secure network servers. Identifying information (name and email address) will be stored in separate (but linked) data tables so that health-related data can be viewed by study staff as needed without inadvertent association with identifiers when such linkage is not required.</p>
  <p>The Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Study is very experienced in data management for multicenter clinical studies and takes the following data security measures:</p>
  <p>•                    Data Transmission: The SAPCON web server (provisioned by Partners Research Computing) currently utilizes 128-bit secure socket layer (SSL) protocol which protects all data transmission sent over the Internet between the web server and every client machine (including our research participants’ machines) that accesses our study web sites.</p>
  <p>•                    Secure Server Room: All study data is housed in a secure server room. The server room is in a building that is locked outside of normal business hours, and in a limited access locked suite fitted with an Access Control System. Within the locked suite is a locked server room fitted with an additional secure door. Only critical Information Systems staff possess the access code required to enter this room. All who enter this room must sign a Server Room Access Log in accordance with Partners HealthCare Information Technology-approved Standard Operating Procedures.</p>
  <p>•                    Antivirus Software: All servers are protected from viruses by McAfee VirusScan. This software automatically checks for virus signature file updates once an hour, and if necessary, directly updates itself. All antivirus software is monitored and network personnel notified in the event that the software stops functioning on a server.</p>
  <p>•                    Firewall: The network, including all the servers that will store our research data, is behind a secure firewall that does not allow unauthorized access to any research data server.</p>
  <p>•                    Disaster Recovery: The study database is backed up twice nightly to another secure file server and eventually to tape, which is stored off-site and allows for system and data recovery even in the event that our server room is destroyed. Our disaster recovery system also follows Standard Operating Procedures to maintain full security of backup data.</p>
