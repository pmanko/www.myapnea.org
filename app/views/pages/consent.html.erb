  CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN A RESEARCH STUDY
</p>

<p>
  <span class="bold">Study Title:</span>
  Module 1: SAPCON Study
</p>

<p>The SAPCON Study is a medical research study led by Drs. Jeffery Olgin, Mark Pletcher, and Gregory Marcus.
  These physicians and the SAPCON Study staff are available to answer any questions you may have.</p>

<p>Research studies include only people who choose to take part. Please take your time to make your decision about
  participating, and discuss your decision with your family or friends if you wish. If you have any questions, you may
  ask the researchers.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Why is this study being done?</strong></p>

    <p>The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of cardiovascular disease and find new ways of
      preventing disease.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>How many people will take part in this study?</strong></p>

    <p>We hope to enroll at least 50,000 people in this study</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Am I eligible to participate in the study?</strong></p>

    <p>To participate, you need to be at least 18 years old.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>What will happen if I take part in this research study?</p>

    <p><em>Surveys</em></p>

    <p>If you agree to participate in the SAPCON Study, you will be asked to complete a series of surveys about
      your life and health. The surveys will ask about such things as your blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking and
      other habits, and your history of heart disease, if any. The basic surveys will take less than 1 hour to complete
      for most people.</p>

    <p>You will be asked to update information on these surveys every six months or as your health changes.</p>

    <p><em>Other study activities</em></p>

    <p>As a SAPCON study participant, you may be invited to participate in additional study activities, or
      “modules” of the SAPCON Study. Each of these modules has a separate consent form and will be explained in
      detail so you may determine if you would like to be a part of it. Participation in these additional study modules
      will be optional. That is, you can still be a SAPCON study participant without participating.</p>

    <p><em>Reminders and study communications</em></p>

    <p>When there is a study activity that we want you to complete or consider, we will contact you. The study will
      offer a variety of communication options that you can choose from.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>How long will I be in the study?</strong></p>

    <p>We would like to keep track of your health status for a very long time. Keeping in touch with you and checking on
      your health periodically over many years will help us look at the long-term effects of cardiovascular disease and
      compare the health of those with and without cardiovascular disease. We plan to do this by contacting you at least
      twice a year.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Can I stop being in the study?</strong></p>

    <p>Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. We won’t delete the information about you that we’ve already collected,
      but we will stop collecting any new information about you and will stop contacting you.</p>

    <p>To stop participating in the study, please send an email to the study staff at:
      <a href="mailto:coordinator@health-eheartstudy.org" title="Contact a Coordinator">Coordinator@health-eheartstudy.org</a>.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?</strong></p>

    <p>Although we will do our best to protect your study information (see below), there is still a very small risk of
      loss of privacy. There is a risk that participating in the study will make you want to access the healthcare
      system more often, and that costs money. For example, the cardiovascular health information that we provide to you
      (see ‘Benefits’) might make you want to talk to your health care provider, or you may want to make extra visits to
      your provider in order to fill out a survey. While there may often be benefits to you from seeing your healthcare
      provider, there are also costs, and the SAPCON Study will not pay for any of your medical care. You should
      not see your healthcare provider solely for the purpose of collecting data for the SAPCON Study.</p>

    <p>For more information about risks and side effects, ask one of the researchers.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Are there benefits to taking part in the study?</strong></p>

    <p>You will not obtain any direct health benefits from participating in the study, but you will receive a simple
      assessment of your cardiovascular health based on the information you provide throughout the study. We hope that
      society will benefit from your participation — by participating, you will help us contribute to a better
      understand of heart disease and find better ways to predict, prevent, and treat heart disease.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Will I get advice about my health from the study?</strong></p>

    <p>No. We will provide you with information about your cardiovascular health (see ‘Benefits’) but we will not
      provide you with any advice, even if the information you provide us is very abnormal. The health information that
      we provide to you does not in any way substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment that
      your doctor or other healthcare provider may give you. Always ask the advice of your healthcare provider if you
      have any questions about a medical condition. Do not disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking
      care because of something you have read as part of this study. If you think you may have a medical emergency, call
      your doctor or dial 911 immediately.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study?</strong></p>

    <p>You are free to choose not to participate in the study. If you decide not to take part in this study, there will
      be no penalty to you.</p>

    <p>We will do our best to make sure that the personal information in your medical record is kept private. However,
      we cannot guarantee total privacy. Your personal information may be given out if required by law. If information
      from this study is published or presented at scientific meetings or shared with other researchers interested in
      heart disease, your name and other personal information will not be used.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>How is my information protected?</strong></p>

    <p>We will do our best to make sure that the personal information we collect about you is kept private and secure.
      <em><strong>The SAPCON Study will never sell, rent, or lease your contact information.</strong></em> If
      information from this study is published or presented at scientific meetings, your name and other personal
      information will not be used. However, we cannot guarantee total privacy — your personal information may be given
      out if required by law (e.g., to prevent possible injury to yourself or others).</p>

    <p>Your information will be transmitted and stored using very secure systems. The network servers where your data
      are stored sit behind firewalls that do not allow unauthorized access and are physically located in a secure
      server room that can only be accessed by critical staff members.</p>

    <p>For details please see our Privacy Policy and Data Security Measures, attached at the end of this consent
      form.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>What are the costs of taking part in this study?</strong></p>

    <p>You will not be charged for any of the study treatments or procedures.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Will I be paid for taking part in this study?</strong></p>

    <p>You will not be paid for taking part in this study, but you will receive free valet parking for your in-person
      study visits.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>What are my rights if I take part in this study?</strong></p>

    <p>Taking part in this study is your choice. You may choose either to take part or not to take part in the study. If
      you decide to take part in this study, you may leave the study at any time. No matter what decision you make,
      there will be no penalty to you.</p>

    <p>We will tell you about new information or changes in the study that may affect your willingness to continue in
      the study.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Who can answer my questions about the study?</strong></p>

    <p>You can talk with the study researcher or study staff about any questions, concerns, or complaints you have about
      this study by calling 415-51-HEART (514-3278), by emailing your study at

<ul>
  <li><em>We will use your information for research</em>: We collect information about your identity, your health, and
    some of your behaviors that might help us predict your future health. This information will be used in research
    analyses and results of these analyses will be presented in scientific conferences and published. These
    presentations and publications will never show any information that identifies you or any other individual in the
    study.
  </li>

  <li>We will not share your information: We will never sell, rent, or lease your information, and we will never
    voluntarily share identifying information about you without your permission.
  </li>

  <li><em>You will be able to see some of your study information</em>: When you registered for the study, you provided
    us with a username and a password. You can use this to sign into the study and see your Dashboard and some of the
    health information you’ve provided to us (e.g., your Cardiovascular Health Profile). You should be very careful not
    to provide your login information to anyone else, or they could sign in as you and be able to see that same health
    information. If you are worried that someone else may be using your login information, please let us know
    immediately, or change your password yourself through the Participant Homepage.
  </li>

  <li><em>Protection Against Involuntary Disclosure of Your Information</em>: We will do everything we can to keep your
    study information private. To further help us protect your privacy, we have obtained a Certificate of
    Confidentiality from the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Under the terms of the
    certificate, the SAPCON Study staff cannot be compelled to disclose study information that identifies you,
    even if ordered by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative,
    or other proceedings. The researchers will use the Certificate to resist any demands for information that would
    identify you, except to prevent serious harm to yourself or others. You should understand that we will, in all
    cases, take the necessary action, including reporting to authorities, to prevent serious harm to yourself or others.
    Also, please note that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not represent an endorsement of the research study by
    DHHS or the National Institutes of Health.
  </li>

  <li><em>Disclosure of Your Information by You</em>: A Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you from
    voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this study.
  </li>

  <li><em>Electronic Security and Adherence to the HIPAA Privacy Rule</em>: The SAPCON Study follows the security
    guidelines of the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). All study data is
    transmitted, stored, and processed in a secure environment.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DATA SECURITY MEASURES</strong> <a href="#top" title="top">» Back to top</a></p>

<p>The following is a technical explanation of the measures we take to protect your data. If you have any questions
  about this information, please contact us by email at Coordinator@Health-eHeartStudy , or by using one of the other
  options described in the “Contact Us” section of the website.</p>

<p>The UCSF Coordinating Center will host the web and database servers for the SAPCON Study. All study
  information will be stored in linked data tables on the UCSF Coordinating Center’s secure network servers. Identifying
  information (name and email address) will be stored in separate (but linked) data tables so that health-related data
  can be viewed by study staff as needed without inadvertent association with identifiers when such linkage is not
  required.</p>

<p>The UCSF Coordinating Center is very experienced in data management for multicenter clinical studies and takes the
  following data security measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Data Transmission</em>: The UCSF Coordinating Center currently utilizes 128-bit secure socket layer (SSL)
    protocol which protects all data transmission sent over the internet between the Coordinating Center’s web server
    and every client machine (including our research participants’ machines) that accesses our study web sites.
  </li>

  <li><em>Secure Server Room</em>: All study data is housed in a secure server room. The server room is in a building
    that is locked outside of normal business hours, and in a limited access locked suite fitted with an Access Control
    System. Within the locked suite is a locked server room fitted with an additional secure door. Only critical
    Information Systems staff possess the access code required to enter this room. All who enter this room must sign a
    Server Room Access Log in accordance with UCSF Information Technology-approved Standard Operating Procedures.
  </li>

  <li><em>Antivirus Software</em>: All servers are protected from viruses by McAfee VirusScan. This software
    automatically checks for virus signature file updates once an hour, and if necessary, directly updates itself. All
    antivirus software is monitored and network personnel notified in the event that the software stops functioning on a
    server.
  </li>

  <li>Firewall: The network, including all the servers that will store our research data, is behind a secure firewall
    that does not allow unauthorized access to any research data server.
  </li>

  <li><em>Disaster Recovery</em>: The study database is backed up twice nightly to another secure file server and
    eventually to “tape”, which is stored off-site and allows for system and data recovery even in the event that our
    server room is destroyed. Our disaster recovery system also follows Standard Operating Procedures to maintain full
    security of backup data.
  </li>
</ul>
