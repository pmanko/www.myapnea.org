        multiple, serious and chronic diseases. Funded by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI),

        The Association's governing board of directors includes both health care professionals
        and patients and patient advocates among its members. ASAA policy, however, requires
        that a majority of the directors always be patients and their advocates. The bylaws also require
        that the chair of the board be a patient or patient advocate to ensure that the ASAA would always be a
        patient-driven organization.
